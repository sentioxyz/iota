/// 1. The certificate must be causing all validators to either panic or hang

/// 2. If we ever ship a fix to make it no longer panic or hang when executing
///    such transaction, we must make sure the transaction is already in this
///    list. Otherwise nodes running the newer version without these
///    transactions in the list will generate forked result.
///
/// Below is a scenario of when we need to use this list:
/// 1. We detect that a specific transaction is causing all validators to either
///    panic or hang forever deterministically.
/// 2. We push a CertificateDenyConfig to deny such transaction to all
///    validators asap.
/// 3. To make sure that all fullnodes are able to sync to the latest version,
///    we need to add the transaction digest to this list as well asap, and ship
///    this binary to all fullnodes, so that they can sync past this
///    transaction.
/// 4. We then can start fixing the issue, and ship the fix to all nodes.
/// 5. Unfortunately, we can't remove the transaction digest from this list,
///    because if we do so, any future node that sync from genesis will fork on
///    this transaction. We may be able to remove it once we have stable
///    snapshots and the binary has a minimum supported protocol version past
